# Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) Database

This repository is an ongoing work in progress that contains a collection of Adverse Outcome Pathway databases and scripts designed for querying and visualizing these pathways. The focus of this project is on ecotoxicological applications, particularly the representation of Molecular Initiating Events (MIEs) and Key Events (KEs) within AOPs and deeper insights into toxicodynamics.

## About AOPs

Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) provide a structured framework for understanding the sequence of events leading from a molecular-level perturbation (MIE) to an adverse outcome at the organism or population level. This repository aims to consolidate AOP information relevant to ecotoxicology and facilitate the exploration of relationships between MIEs and KEs.
